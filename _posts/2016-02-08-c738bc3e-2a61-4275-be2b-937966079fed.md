I came to see that everything that exists in the universe is a reflection of myself. Every person, every thought, every feeling. That left me with a great sense of responsibility and inner clarity. This became the end of victimhood. And the beginning of deep maturity. I started to see that I am responsible for every experience that I generate within myself. That was really humbling. And left released the tendency within me to fix others. To make them better people, to heal them.. To tell them how things are. If I can wait to tell you how things are I know how how things are without the need to tell you. That's real freedom. You are great the way you are. Without me telling you how to get there.
